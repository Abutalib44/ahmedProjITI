A pull request (sometimes called merge requests), is a review request. You are asking someone to check the changes on a branch before merging into another branch.
A pull request is related to version control systems. You may have several sets of users:

    Administrators/Owners
    Contributors
    Testers

    Administrators/Owners
    These people can be trusted. They might have full access to the repository in question, including full rights to commit what they want when they want.
    Contributors
    These might be random people from the Internet; they might be lesser people in a company. Either way, you probably don't want them to be able to commit straight to the codebase - you want to review their changes first.
